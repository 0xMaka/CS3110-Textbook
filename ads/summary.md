# Summary

We've covered a few data structures that you don't typically
see in an introductory data structures course&mdash;streams, red-black
trees, promises, and monads&mdash;as well as mutable data structures.

There are many other exciting data structures out there in the world
for you to learn.  One great source is Chris Okasaki's book, cited
below.  It goes much deeper into how to implement various
data structures from the imperative world, but in a functional
language.

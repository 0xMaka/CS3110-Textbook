# Programming Languages

A great general-purpose programming language...

- lets you say things concisely and understandably at the right level
  of abstraction;

- lets you extend the language with new features that are specific to
  a domain but blend in well with the rest of the language;

- makes it easy to write *correct* code, with good performance;

- makes it easy to change the code when you find out the specification
  has changed;

- makes it easy to re-use code; and

- is easy to learn.

There are probably thousands of general-purpose languages.
But there are no universally great programming languages.

General-purpose languages come and go.  In your life you'll likely learn
a handful.  Today, it's Java and C++.  Yesterday, it was Pascal and C.
Before that, it was Fortran and Lisp.  Who knows what it will be tomorrow?
And you'll likely use dozens of special-purpose languages for particular
projects.  In this fast changing field you need to be able to
rapidly adapt.

**A good programmer has to learn *how to learn* new languages.**

We use a zillion different programming languages to communicate with
machines and one another:

- general purpose and scripting:  Fortran, Lisp, Basic, C, Pascal, Scheme, C++,
  Java, C#, Visual Basic, Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, Clojure, Scala,
  Erlang, Swift, ...

- tools:  awk, sed, tcl, sh, csh, bash, ...

- search: regular expressions, browser queries, SQL, ...

- display and rendering:  PostScript, PDF, HTML, XML, ...

- hardware:  CCS, VHDL, Verilog, ...

- theorem proving and mathematics:  Mathematica, Maple, Matlab, R, NuPRL,
  Isabelle/HOL, ACL2, Coq

It's crucial that you understand the *principles* behind programming
that transcend the specifics of any specific language. There's no better
way to get at these principles than to approach programming from a
completely different perspective.

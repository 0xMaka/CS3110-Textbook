# Summary

Syntax and semantics are a powerful paradigm for learning a programming
language.  As we learn the features of OCaml, we're being careful to write
down their syntax and semantics.  We've seen that there can be multiple
syntaxes for expressing the same semantic idea, that is, the same computation.
The semantics of function application is the very heart of OCaml and of
functional programming, and it's something we will come back to several
times throughout the course to deepen our understanding.
